Odin Landing Page:

Project 2 of the Foundations course for the CSS section. This project will demonstrate basic CSS skills, including but not limited to:
  basic styling (colors, text, borders, etc.)
  layout (flexbox, html placement, responsiveness)
  Aesthetics (choice of fonts, colors, images, JS...)
  UI (functionality and ease of use (site not actually functional, but will emulate functionality))

By the end of this project, I will have basic fluency in HTML and CSS as well as a bit of intermediate and hopefully advanced tools to use. 
I will be able to create any basic page with ease after this.
