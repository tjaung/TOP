    <p>Odin's hall is based off of the Monty Hall problem, a statistical brain teaser originating from the American TV game show <i>Let's Make a Deal</i> and named after the original host, Monty Hall.</p>
    <p>You are presented with 3 doors with 1 containing a prize. To win, you must choose the correct door with the prize. You begin by guessing 1 of the 3 doors. After you make your choice, the host will open 1 of the remaining doors, revealing no prize behind it.
       You are now presented with the option of switching to the last remaining door, or staying with your original choice. The problem lies in whether you make the switch or not.</p>
    <p>Taken at face value, this seems like a simple problem: Regardless of whether you switch or not, you have a 50/50 chance of winning since only 2 doors remain. However, the truth is that you would have an advantage by switching doors. By switching doors, you increase your chances of winning to 2/3.
       Initially, you have a 1/3 chance of guessing correctly at the onset of the game, so why would the probability change? The paradox is that initially the 2 doors you did not select were equally likely to be winners. After the host reveals one of the losing doors, the other remaining door is now twice as likely as your choice to contain the prize.
       Let's use some scenarios to simplify this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>You pick the first door and the second door is the winner. The host reveals that the third door contains nothing. If we switch we win.</li>
      <li>You choose the second door which is the winner. The host shows that the third door contains nothing. If we switch to the first door, we lose.</li>
      <li>You select the third door. The host reveals that the first door is a losing door. You switch to the second door and win.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In 2 out of 3 of these scenarios, switching doors leads to a win. Another simple way to examine the problem is to imagine that there are 100 doors with only 1 containing the prize. Say you choose the first door in line. The host knows which door contains the prize, and he begins opening all the other 99 doors except door 59. Would you switch your choice?</p> 
    <p>The answer to this problem became world reknowned when Marilyn Vos Savant answered the question in her 'Ask Marilyn' section in <i>Parade</i> Magazine. Initially she was met with criticism from many people, including statisticians, but this is the accepted answer nowadays. If you don't believe it, why not try for yourself? Try switching doors everytime and see how many times you win and lose.</p>
    <p>Side note: You would need to play for a while, say at least 50 times to really draw any real conclusions (learn about the law of large numbers and sample sizes <a href='https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/law-of-large-numbers/'>here</a>)</p>
