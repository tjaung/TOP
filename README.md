Repo for The Odin Project. This repo will be documentation of my learning for front-end development (with a little back-end and CS concepts). 
The Odin Project is currently broken up into two parts: Foundations and Advanced tracks.  

 - The Foundations course works on the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS, while touching on some important coding concepts.  

 - The second half has 2 possible tracks: Ruby on Rails, and Javascript. The course content is for the most part identical, but each dives into a different back-end framework specific to that language. The second half continues to build onto the Foundations course with more complex HTML and CSS, as well as the respective scripting language. I have chosen the Javascript path due to it's wider use and so I can learn about Node.js and the React Framework.  

Each respective course will show links to the completed projects. Hopefully this can become a strong demonstratation of my growth in web development and understanding of CS.
